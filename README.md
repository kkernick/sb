# SB

An application to sandbox applications.

There are two implementations:

1. [Python-SB](./python/README.md) is the Python implementation. It is no longer maintained, but still fully functional.
2. [SB++](./cpp/README.md) is the C++ implementation. It has been written from the ground up and is faster, more functional, and easier to use. Its PGO build recipe and aggressive optimizations significantly speed up all operations. It's the recommended option.
